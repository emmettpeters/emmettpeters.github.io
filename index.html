			<h2>Business and education</h2><blockquote>It's dangerous business describing yourself for an employer or anyone else for that matter, but here goes. I'm an extremely goofy and self-confident country kid from Castroville, Texas. I spend my off-time working outside as much as possible on different projects I come up with. Ever since I first started school I have both enjoyed and been quite apt at math and sciences. After highschool I worked for a small construction/HVAC company and learned everything I needed to build any sized building from the ground up (foundation,framing,electrical,ac,plumbing...etc). As of 2014 I am debt free and have been investing most of my disposable income in whatever I feel will make me some money. Most recently it has been buying, fixing up, and reselling used cars and properties. My last two vehicles I've flipped have sold for over 2.5 times what they were bought for. Now that I have a bit more capital behind me, a friend and I are looking into trading both International and Cryptocurrencies. I have been interested in coding and programming ever since I did an internship at SouthWest Research and I was exposed to just how many different problems can be solved and things can be done with even a low-level of understanding. Now, going through CodeUp, I'm learning that my passion for coding is growing rapidly as I almost can't help but learn something new and fascinating every day. I cannot wait to see where this knowledge takes me and all the new people I'll meet.</blockquote>

			<div><h2>Personal Info</h2><blockquote>My father explained to me at a very young age that worrying and/or stressing about anything does not help any situation, and I took that to heart. I don't truly understand what stress is anymore. If I have a problem I just start working on a solution.<br>Living in the country has allowed me to explore and do so many different things. I have always been adventurous and kind of eccentric with my pet choices. I've personally owned and tamed horses, donkeys, snakes, sheep, chickens, turkeys, peacocks, ducks and I currently have the most spoiled Emu in existence(Roux). I tried owning an iguana for it but theyre not much for socializing so it wasnt a good fit haha. My friends and I have made what we call "testing videos" where we simulate product durability tests for whatever product we own that breaks. (washing machines, microwaves, xbox/ps/computers... etc) I watched the price of fireworks skyrocket when I was young, so I started making my own. Now fourth of July and New Years are just both excuses for my friends and family to come and see how large of explosions my brother and I can make that year. Ive been a semi-adrenaline junkie since I built my first Go-Cart from scratch at 12 years old. This prompted me to acquire my skydiving certification in 2012. Ive been jumping/falling ever since and loving every minute of it. I cannot sit an play videogames or watch TV because I feel like I'm wasting time that I could have used to learn, invent, or work on something with.</blockquote>
